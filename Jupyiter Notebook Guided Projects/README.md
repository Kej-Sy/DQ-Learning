#### Exploring Hacker News Posts

<details>
  <summary>Click to see description of project</summary>

[Hacker News]("https://news.ycombinator.com/") is a website where user-submitted stories (beter know as posts) recives votes and comments. It's popular in technology and startup circle.

For my analzy two type of post are interesting:

- `Ask HN`: questions to the community,
- `Show HN`: announcements and showcasing of products, projects etc.

In our analysis, we will determine:

- Which post(`Ask HN` or `Show HN`) receive more comments on average.
- Whether posts created at a certain time of the day receive more comments on average.

We'll be working with the [`hacker_news.csv`]("https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/356/hacker_news.csv") dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Click to see description of project</summary>

What the project is about:
- I'm going to analyze a dataset about the westbound traffic on the [I-94 Interstate highway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_94). The dataset can be download from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume) and was created by John Hogue.

My goal with this project:
-  is to determine indicators of heavy traffic on I-94.

</details>

#### Storytelling Data Visualization on Exchange Rates

<details>
  <summary>Click to see description of project</summary>

In these project I will use [the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lsind18/euro-exchange-daily-rates-19992020), created by Daria Chemkaeva, which describe Euro daily exchange rate between 1999 and 2021. The euro (symbolized with €) is the official currency in most of the countries of the European Union.

If the exchange rate of the euro to the US dollar is 1.5, you get 1.5 $ if you pay 1.0 € (one euro has more value than one US dollar at this exchange rate). 

</details>

#### Clean and Analyze Employee Exit Surveys

<details>
  <summary>Click to see description of project</summary>

In these project I will b eworking with [exit survrys from employees of the  Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE)](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. Slighty modifications was made in the orginal dataset to make the work on it easier. One of them was changing encoding from `cp1252` to `UTF-8`.

My goal is to find answers for below questions:

- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

#### Analyzing NYC High School Data

<details>
  <summary>Click to see description of project</summary>

This analysis aims to explore the relationships between SAT scores and various demographic factors in New York City public schools. As a brief background, the SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is a standardized test taken by high school seniors in the U.S., and colleges often use it as a criterion for admissions. Higher average SAT scores are typically associated with better-performing schools.

To conduct this study, we will merge and analyze multiple datasets containing student SAT scores and additional demographic information for each public high school in New York. By combining these datasets, we hope to gain valuable insights into the potential factors that may impact the average SAT scores in these schools and gain a comprehensive understanding of the educational landscape in the city.

Below are the links to all the datasets used in this project:

- SAT scores by school - SAT scores for each high school in New York City
- School attendance - Attendance information for each school in New York City
- Class size - Information on class size for each school
- AP test results - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)
- Graduation outcomes - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information
- Demographics - Demographic information for each school
- School survey - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school

All of these datasets are interrelated. We'll need to combine them into a single dataset before we can find correlations.
Background Research

Goals of the project

High school students take the AP exams before applying to college. There are several AP exams, each corresponding to a school subject. High school students who earn high scores may receive college credit.

The objectives of the project include:

- Investigating the potential correlation between AP exam scores and SAT scores among high schools.
- Analyzing the equity aspect of the SAT by examining correlations between demographic factors such as race, gender, safety level, percentage of English learners, class size, and SAT scores.

#### Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings

<details>
  <summary>Click to see description of project</summary>

**Content:**

In October 2015 data journalist Walt Hickey analyzed movie ratings data from Fandango (an online movie ratings aggregator) and found evidence that rating system was dishonest.

Fandango displays a 5-star rating system on their website, where the minimum rating is 0 stars and the maximum is 5 stars. In the HTML of the page Hickey found out significant discrepancy between the number od stars display to users and the actual rating. He found that:

- The actual rating was almost always rounded up to the nearest half-star. For instance, a 4.1 movie would be rounded off to 4.5 stars, not to 4 stars, as you may expect.
- In the case of 8% of the ratings analyzed, the rounding up was done to the nearest whole star. For instance, a 4.5 rating would be rounded off to 5 stars.
- For one movie rating, the rounding off was completely bizarre: from a rating of 4 in the HTML of the page to a displayed rating of 5 stars.

**Goal:**

In this project we will analyze more recent movie ratings data to determinate if there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis.

#### Mobile App for Lottery Addiction

<details>
  <summary>Click to see description of project</summary>

In this project, we intend to lay the groundwork for a mobile application by writing some functions to calculate the probability of winning the lottery. The app aims to both prevent and treat lottery addiction by helping people better estimate their chances of winning.

The idea of the app comes from the medical institute which is speciaized in treating gambling addictions. The institute has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need us to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities. For the first version of the app, they want us to focus on the [6/49](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49) lottery and build functions that enable users to answer questions like:
- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?
- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?
- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?

The scenario we're following throughout this project is fictional — the main purpose is to practice applying the concepts we learned in a setting that simulates a real-world scenario.

#### Building a Spam Filter with Naive Bayes

<details>
  <summary>Click to see description of project</summary>

In this project, we're going to build a spam filter for SMS messages using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. Our goal is to create a spam filter that classifies new messages with an accuracy greater than 80% — so we expect that more than 80% of the new messages will be classified correctly as spam or ham (non-spam).

To train the algorithm, we'll use a dataset of 5,572 SMS messages that are already classified by humans. The dataset was put together by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo, and it can be downloaded from the [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection). The data collection process is described in more details [on this page](http://www.dt.fee.unicamp.br/~tiago/smsspamcollection/#composition), where you can also find some of the authors' papers.

#### Winning Jeopardy

<details>
  <summary>Click to see description of project</summary>

Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money. It's been running for many years, and is a major force in popular culture.

We want to compete on Jeopardy and looking for any way to win it. So in this project, we'll work with a [dataset](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file) of Jeopardy questions, which contains 20000 rows from the beginning of a full dataset, to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help win.

#### Predicting Heart Disease

<details>
  <summary>Click to see description of project</summary>

Accordingly to [The World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/health-topics/cardiovascular-diseases) estimates, 17.9 million people die each year from cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Risk factors that can contribute to CVD include: an unhealthy diet, physical inactivity or mental illness. Identifying these risk factors early on could help prevent many premature deaths.

In these project we will be working with [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) and build a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier to predict a patient's likelihood of heart disease in the future.
