In fact, word repetition is not an ideal proxy for repeated questions, because we may have repetition in the structure words rather than the “key words” that really define the meaning of the questions. We may need to sieve through our collected list to find the real repeated questions. Anyway, studying repeat questions will at least give us some general ideas and familiarities of the format/styles of the completion, and thus we will secure to ace the frequently asked questions and avoid the embossing scores during the competition. As to the difficult questions, they are rare and usually unique, so they may not be included in the recycled questions; we definitely need explore other means to be able to stand out."
