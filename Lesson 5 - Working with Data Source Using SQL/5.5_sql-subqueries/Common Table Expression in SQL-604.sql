## 2. Using a Single CTE ##

WITH
customer_avg_table AS (SELECT customer_id, AVG(total) AS total_avg
          FROM invoice
         GROUP BY customer_id)

SELECT c.last_name, c.first_name, i.total_avg
  FROM customer AS c
  JOIN customer_avg_table AS i
    ON c.customer_id = i.customer_id;

## 3. Multiple CTEs ##

WITH
country_invoice_total_table AS (SELECT billing_country, SUM(total) AS invoice_total
          FROM invoice
         GROUP BY billing_country),
country_total_table AS (SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS customer_tally
          FROM customer
         GROUP BY country)

SELECT ct.country, 
        ROUND(i.invoice_total / ct.customer_tally, 2) AS sale_avg
  FROM country_invoice_total_table AS i
  JOIN country_total_table AS ct
    ON i.billing_country = ct.country
 ORDER BY sale_avg DESC
 LIMIT 5;

## 4. CTE Constraints ##

WITH 
usa_invoice_table AS (
    SELECT invoice_id 
      FROM invoice 
     WHERE billing_country = 'USA' 
), 
invoice_line_track_table AS (
    SELECT il.*, t.milliseconds, t.genre_id 
      FROM invoice_line il 
      JOIN track t 
        ON il.track_id = t.track_id 
), 
usa_track_table AS ( 
    SELECT i.* 
      FROM invoice_line_track_table i 
      JOIN usa_invoice_table u 
        ON i.invoice_id = u.invoice_id 
), 
metal_genre_table AS ( 
    SELECT genre_id 
      FROM genre 
     WHERE name LIKE '%Metal%' 
), 
metal_usa_track_table AS ( 
    SELECT * 
      FROM usa_track_table u 
      JOIN metal_genre_table m 
        ON u.genre_id = m.genre_id 
) 
    SELECT invoice_id AS invoice_id, 
           SUM(quantity * unit_price) AS total, 
           SUM(milliseconds)/1000.0/60 AS minute 
      FROM metal_usa_track_table 
     GROUP BY invoice_id;

## 7. Recursive CTEs Anatomy ##

WITH RECURSIVE
managers_chain(employee_id, path) AS (

SELECT employee_id, last_name || ' ' || first_name AS path 
  FROM employee
 WHERE reports_to IS NULL
 
 UNION ALL
 
-- TODO: Write the recursive member here
SELECT e.employee_id, 
       m.path || '<--' || e.last_name || ' ' || e.first_name AS path
  FROM employee e
  JOIN managers_chain m
    ON e.reports_to = m.employee_id
 )
 
SELECT path
  FROM managers_chain;
